## 📚 Introduction

Welcome to the Traffic Object Detection system using YOLOv3! This application helps you detect vehicles, pedestrians, and other road objects in live or recorded video streams. With features like Frames Per Second (FPS) overlay and scene Intersection over Union (IoU) analysis, you can easily monitor traffic conditions. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

Here you will find the steps to download and run the application effortlessly. 

## 🔥 Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Monitor live video streams for traffic activities.
- **Object Types:** Detect vehicles, pedestrians, and road objects.
- **Performance Metrics:** View FPS and scene IoU analysis during detection.
- **Easy to Use:** Designed for non-technical users.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before you start, ensure your computer meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10, macOS, or a recent Linux distribution.
- **Processor:** Dual-core processor or better.
- **RAM:** At least 4 GB of RAM.
- **Graphics Card:** A modern GPU for optimal performance (recommended: NVIDIA).
- **Storage:** Minimum of 500 MB free disk space.

## ⚙️ Running the Application

1. Open the application from your desktop or applications folder.
  
2. You will see the main interface. Choose to open a live stream from a camera or select a recorded video file.

3. Adjust settings, such as video source and detection thresholds, if needed. 

4. Click on 'Start' to begin detecting objects in the video stream.

5. Monitor the FPS and IoU metrics in real time on the screen.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, try the following:

- Ensure your system meets the requirements.
- Check that your camera or video source is functioning and properly connected.
- Restart the application if it doesn't load correctly.
